## What are the Design Fundamentals?

### 1.Color & Contrast
* Make sure to take color contrast enough to tell one element from the others

If you put color which has not enough contrast from the other elements, it'll make content difficult to recognize.

### 2.White Space
* Take enough white space to keep consistency and make contents look organized

If you don't take enough white space, users will feel contents unorganized.

### 3.Visual Hierarchy
* Adjust color density, thickness, and size of character to make it clear which information is important.

If you choose similar color density, thickness, and size for each information,  users might be confused because they are not sure which information is important.

### 4.Complexity vs. Simplicity
* More is not better! If you add some effect to some elements, use it properly. Especially at first when you start to study design, make it simple as much as you can.

If you add a lot of effects to elements, users will feel it's too much.If you add a lot of effects to elements, users will feel it's too much.

### 5.Consistency
* Keep consistency of every component. You should unify font type, text-align and so on.

For example, if you use three types of font in the same UI, users will feel it mixed-up. You should care about text-align as well.

### 6.Scale
* You should make each element proper scale according to the purpose of the element.

If the element is an input area, you should make the letter proper size to read easily. The letter of a button doesn't need to be such a big size as well.
